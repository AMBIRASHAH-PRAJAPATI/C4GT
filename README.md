# C4GT23
C4GT is open to students and working professionals who possess the requisite coding skills. It is open to anyone who is interested in software development and who wants to contribute to open-source projects.
India has witnessed a remarkable growth of Digital Public Goods (DPGs) in recent times. The launch of Namma Yatri, a collaborative effort of Beckn Open Collective, Juspay, and Auto Rickshaw Drivers Union Bangalore, exemplifies this trend.

To further this growth, Code for GovTech (C4GT) has been introduced as India's first dedicated mentoring program, aimed at creating a community that can build and contribute to global DPGs. Participants selected for the program will work on live open-source projects targeted at solving population-scale governance challenges. They will receive close mentoring from experienced practitioners from Indian GovTech organizations, and a stipend of 1 Lakh for the duration of the program. Additionally, participants have the opportunity to secure a PPI and PPO after the program ends.

This program is run by Samagra, a mission-driven governance consulting firm, and supported by Digital Public Goods Alliance and Omidyar Network India as knowledge partners.
